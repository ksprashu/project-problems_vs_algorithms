# Project #3 - Problems vs Algorithms
## Udacity Nanodegree - Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo contains projects that I am working on as part of this course.

Please note that these solutions have been written by me as part of my learning.

plagiarism of this code explicity violates the [Udacity Honor Code](https://www.udacity.com/legal/en-us/honor-code).

Please be true to yourself and write your own solutions to the problems and do not copy the code provided here.

## Running Instructions
All code should run on a regular python interpreter and will output the results
to the console. The expected output is mentioned in each program as comments.

1. Problem 1 - Find sqrt of a number without using standard functions
```bash
$ python problem_1.py
```

2. Problem 2 - Search for an element in a rotated array
```bash
$ python problem_2.py
```

3. Problem 3 - Find two numbers from array with largest sum
```bash
$ python problem_3.py
```

4. Problem 4 - Sort an array of only 0, 1, 2 as elements
```bash
$ python problem_4.py
```

5. Problem 5 - Autocomplete using Tries\
This is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook.
```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```

6. Problem 6 - Get the min, max from a list of integers
```bash
$ python problem_6.py
```
```
Jupyter -> Open `problem_5.ipynb`
```

7. Problem 7 - Build a Router using Tries
```bash
$ python problem_4.py
```
